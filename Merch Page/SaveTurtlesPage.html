                    <p><b>Plastic waste is one of the leading threats to marine life, including turtles.
                         By reducing single-use plastics, properly disposing of waste, and participating in beach cleanups,
                         we can minimize the risk of turtles ingesting or getting entangled in harmful debris. Every piece of plastic
                         removed from the ocean is a step towards a safer habitat for turtles.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Turtles return to the same beaches to nest year after year, but many of these sites are threatened by human activities like construction and tourism. You can help by supporting conservation efforts that protect nesting grounds, keeping beaches clean, and avoiding disturbing turtles during nesting season. Each protected beach is a sanctuary for future generations of turtles.</b></p>

                        year. By supporting fisheries that use turtle-safe practices and

                          we can reduce this threat. Look for seafood products labeled as
